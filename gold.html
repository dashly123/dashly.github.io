				<p class="description">How many ounces of silver can you buy with one ounce of gold? Many traders and precious metals investors will use this ratio to determine which metal to invest in, given the current ratio. <strong>A higher Gold/Silver ratio indicates that silver is undervalued</strong> relative to gold.</p>

			<h2>Investor Sentiment & Leading Indicators for Gold & Silver</h2>

			<p>What is the current sentiment for gold & silver? The following charts will show metrics that attempt to predict the future price of gold and silver.</p>

			<div id="header"><h3>Real Interest Rates vs Gold</h3></div>

			<iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=zbde&width=1125&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden; width:1125px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"></iframe>

			<p class="description"><strong>Weak interest rates favor a higher price of gold.</strong> <br><br>

			The graph shows a strong inverse relationship between the price of gold and real interest rates: when real interest rates rise, the price of gold tends to drop and vice versa. As with any analysis of this kind, it's important to be prudent: even if the relationship is statistically significant, there can be divergences (as in 2005), and it is more realiable over the medium and long term.

			<br><br>
			If you expect real interest rates to decrease, gold appears to be a good bet / hedge.

			<p class="description"><strong>A weak dollar favors a higher price of gold, and vice-versa.</strong> <br><br>

			The graph shows a strong inverse relationship between the price of gold and the US Dollar Index: when the US dollar depreciates against a basket of other currencies, the price of gold tends to increase and vice versa.

			<br><br>
			If you expect the US Dollar to depreciate in relation to other major currencies, it is likely the price of gold will increase (at least in USD).

			<p class="description"><strong>Central bank credit expansion and currency creation tends to favor an increase in the price of gold.</strong> <br><br>

			<p class="description">The CBOE Gold/Silver Volatility Index is a measure of expected price fluctuations in gold and silver options over the next 30 days. It is calculated in real time by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).
				<br><br>
				The key words in that description are <strong>expected and next 30 days</strong>. The predictive nature of the index makes it a measure of implied volatility, not one that is based off historical data or statistical analysis. The time period of the prediction also narrows the outlook to the near term.

			<p class="description">Commodity traders have access to a special market report each week that provides a snapshot of the positions of large institutional traders and small speculators in each commodity futures category. This information is called the commitment of traders report or “COT report” and is provided by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

				<br><br>
				The COT report essentially shows the net long or short positions for each available futures contract. If traders are overwhelmingly long or increasing their long positions then we will have a bullish bias on that market. Similarly, if traders are short or increasing their short positions then we will have a bearish bias.

			<h2>Other Interesting Gold Charts</h2>

			<div id="header"><h3>US Stock Market Priced in Gold</h3></div>

			<iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=zblk&width=1125&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden; width:1125px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"></iframe>

			<p class="description">What relationship do we get if we instead of pricing the US stock market in Dollars, we price it in gold? With heavy intervention in the markets by central banks, many have suggested that stock markets are being artificially fueled by central banks.

				<br><br>
				However, as we see above, the more a Central Bank stimulates the economy via credit expansion, money creation, and driving interest rates down, the price of gold typically increases. Therefore, pricing the market in gold becomes an interesting proposition.

				<br><br>
				The above chart prices the Wilshire 5000 (the broadest index of the US stock market) in ounces of gold; this essentially answers the question of how many ounces of gold would it take to buy a share of US stock market at any given time. This is indicated by the red line.

				<br><br>

				The black line represents the Wilshire 5000 unadjusted and priced in US Dollars. The interesting part is that you can see that starting 2019, the Wilshire 5000 has made new all-time highs, but not in gold terms. So when thinking about whether the stock market is currently overvalued, it might make sense to ask the question: overvalued in relation to what? Fiat currency or hard money?

			</p>

			<div id="header"><h3>Homes Priced in Gold</h3></div>

			<iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=zbms&width=1125&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden; width:1125px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"></iframe>

			<p class="description">What if we price the median sales price of a home in the US in ounces of gold, instead of dollars? Again, with heavy intervention in the markets by central banks, many have suggested that the housing market is artificially being supported by both low interest rates and loose government policies.

			<br><br>
			The U.S. came off the gold standard in 1973, so of real interest in this chart are prices from the mid 1970's onwards.

			<br><br>

			The red line shows how many ounces of gold you'd need to buy a median-priced home in the US. The black line shows the same amount in US dollars.

			<br><br>

			Interestingly, it looks like since the Great Financial Crisis of 2008, where central banks initiated their policies of near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing, the price of a home priced in gold has never been cheaper.

			</p>

			<div id="header"><h3>Oil Priced in Gold</h3></div>

			<iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=zbo4&width=1125&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden; width:1125px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"></iframe>

			<p class="description">Similar to the previously shown charts, there appears to be a inverse relationship between gold and oil.

			<br><br>

			This relationship is interesting to exploit if you are interested in timing stock trades for gold mining companies. When gold prices are high, and the cost of oil is down, gold miners tend to do well given that the major cost of production for mining is fuel (diesel, primarily). Therefore, the more barrels of oil you can buy per ounce of gold, the likelier profits at gold mining companies will be higher.

			<br><br>

			The red line shows how many barrels of oil you can buy with one ounce of gold. The black line shows the cost of a barrel of oil in US Dollars.
