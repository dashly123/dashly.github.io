			<p class="description">Logically, the lower the cost of borrowing, the more liquid the housing market is and the more willing people are to buy and vice-versa.</p>

			<div id="header"><h3>New Housing Starts by Building Permits</h3></div>

			<iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=zcFX&width=1125&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden; width:1125px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"></iframe>

			<p class="description">What are building permits? Along with housing starts, building permits are also a leading indicator of the health of the US housing market. Building permits provide an estimate of the number of new housing units that have been authorized by the government during a given month.</p>

			<div id="header"><h3>Monthly Supply of Homes for Sale</h3></div>
			<iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=zcGx&width=1125&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden; width:1125px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"></iframe>

			<p class="description">The months' supply is the ratio of houses for sale to houses sold. This statistic provides an indication of the size of the for-sale inventory in relation to the number of houses currently being sold. The months' supply indicates how long the current for-sale inventory would last given the current sales rate if no additional new houses were built.</p>

			<div id="header"><h3>Housing Price to Rent Ratio</h3></div>
			<iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=zcI6&width=1125&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden; width:1125px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"></iframe>

			<p class="description">Economic forecasters are always on the lookout for variables that can help predict upcoming recessions. One such variable that has gotten some recent attention is the housing price-rent ratio. As this ratio becomes higher, the rental option becomes more attractive. If it rises high enough, some households might switch from owning their homes to renting them; then the demand for owner-occupied housing would fall. </p>

			<div id="header"><h3>Case-Shiller vs Personal Income</h3></div>
			<iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=zcJk&width=1125&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden; width:1125px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"></iframe>
			<p class="description">The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Indices are the leading measures of U.S. residential real estate prices, tracking changes in the value of residential real estate nationally.</p>

			<div id="header"><h3>Median Sales Price of Houses - Personal Income Per Capita Ratio</h3></div>
			<iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=zcJK&width=1125&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden; width:1125px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"></iframe>
			<p class="description">This ratio demonstrates how many times the average price of a house sold in the US is against personal income per capita.

			<br><br>
			There is a logical correlation between housing prices and personal income - therefore it's interesting to compare the relationshio between the two over time. <strong>A higher ratio indicates housing is expensive.</strong>

			<div id="header"><h3>Delinquency Rates - Mortgages on Single-Family Homes</h3></div>
			<iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=zcKC&width=1125&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden; width:1125px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"></iframe>
			<p class="description">Rising mortgage delinquency rates aren’t a good sign for buyers or investors. This could mean that the average income in an area decreases or that the price of living rises disproportionately to income. It can also mean that mortgage companies issue too many mortgage loans to buyers who were less than ideal candidates. </p>

			<div id="header"><h3>Home ownership rate</h3></div>
			<iframe src="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/graph-landing.php?g=zcL3&width=1125&height=475" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="overflow:hidden; width:1125px; height:525px;" allowTransparency="true" loading="lazy"></iframe>
			<p class="description">A high homeownership percentage correlates with a housing market that’s well-adjusted. When housing is affordable and income is proportionate, homeownership flourishes. If the national homeownership rate falls, it can mean that housing is less affordable. This can mean that it isn’t the ideal time to buy or invest – at least until prices drop. </p>
